            <h2>Will Deepworld RE be online? Offline? Servers?</h2><br>
            <p>
                Deepworld Remastered will start off offline. The game will proceed in development until it is stable.
                Once
                that
                is achieved, dedicated servers will be considered.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>Will PlayerData be stored offline? Will Anticheats be put in place?</h2><br>
            <p>
                Player and World data will be stored offline in .dwd and .dww files. Simple binary files. Anticheats are
                not
                planned at the moment.</p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>What are Universes? How will Worlds and Servers work?</h2><br>
            <p>
                Each "Universe" is just like the original deepworld. Each Universe you join has many worlds, and each
                universe
                has a Character or Player.
                Every single universe you join is different. Differnt worlds, different inventories, different skills /
                levels,
                different ranks, different clothing.
                The only thing that is the same across universes, is your Order of the Sun AND Eye rank, your Player
                Name,
                your
                Leaderboard Data and your Friends List.
                Your "Friends List" is the disabled "Offline" tab ingame. Currently multiplayer does not function, so it
                doesnt
                do anything.</p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>What is the "Order of the Sun"?</h2><br>
            <p>
                The "Order of the Sun" is a new order that was never implemented into the original game. Your rank in
                the
                Order
                of the Sun is completely dependent on your time playing the game.
                To enter the order of the sun (Iron), you must play the game for 2 hours straight without logging off.
                Dedicated. Brass? You must have 24 hours of total play time. Sapphire?
                At least play the game for more than a month. Ruby? 168 hours of ingame time spent playing... A week
                basically.
                Finally, Onyx? You must have played more than 6 months on deepworld. Half a year of existing. Thisll
                take a
                while.</p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>What is the "Order of the Eye"?</h2><br>
            <p>
                The Order of the Eye is an elite force of Veteran Players and Moderators of either Deepworld RE or
                Deepworld.
                Iron represents anyone who took part in Deepworld OG for more than a year. Brass is the rank of
                extremely
                well
                known and trusted users of deepworld og with a long past. Saphire Eye represents the
                arbiters of the Deepworld OG Forum / Discord, and Moderators / Arbiters of Deepworld OG. Ruby represents
                Developers of Deepworld RE and Employees of ByteBin / Especially well known Moderators of Deepworld OG.
                (This is a reference to the Ruby Sign, which could only be placed by deepworld's original Devs or
                Admins).
                Onyx
                Eye represents original Developers or Artists who helped make and create the original deepworld we know
                and
                love.
                Registration for Order of the Eye will only be available when multiplayer arrives. When it does, visit
                the
                discord and contact a moderator or developer.
            </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <h2>Will there be versions for Mobile? iOS and Android? What about mac?</h2><br>
            <p>
                Well mac and windows versions do already exist. There are also plans on setting up a Linux build too. As
                for
                mobile...
                iOS and Android? They <b>will</b> be supported. They are planned to be released alongside the release
                1.0
                update. As for how they will function and be different?
                The mobile versions will still be able to do all the things you can do on PC. When multiplayer is
                setup..
                you
                will be able to join servers on mobile.
